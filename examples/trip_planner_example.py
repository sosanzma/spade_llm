"""
Valencia Trip Planner - Multi-Agent Workflow Example

Multi-agent workflow for comprehensive Valencia trip planning:
Airbnb Search → Route Planning → Plan Creation → Price Review → Final Plan

PREREQUISITES:
1. Start SPADE built-in server in another terminal:
   spade run
   
   (Advanced server configuration available but not needed)

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install spade_llm

This example uses SPADE's default built-in server (localhost:5222) - no account registration needed!

Uses:
- Airbnb MCP for accommodation search
- Valencia Smart City MCP for real-time city data
- Multi-agent coordination with conditional routing
