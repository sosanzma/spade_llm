# Advanced Multi-Feature Agent Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create sophisticated multi-agent systems with advanced features like MCP integration, human-in-the-loop workflows, custom guardrails, and complex routing. This tutorial is based on the `github_issues_monitor_example.py` and demonstrates production-ready patterns.

## What You'll Build

We'll create a comprehensive GitHub monitoring system with four specialized agents:

1. **Chat Agent** - User interface with custom guardrails
2. **Analysis Agent** - GitHub data collection and analysis via MCP
3. **Storage Agent** - Notion integration for data persistence
4. **Notification Agent** - Human-in-the-loop email confirmations

## Prerequisites

- Complete all previous tutorials ([First Agent](first-agent.md), [Guardrails](guardrails-tutorial.md), [Tools](tools-tutorial.md))
- Advanced Python knowledge (classes, async programming, error handling)
- Understanding of multi-agent systems concepts
- Access to external services (GitHub, Notion, Gmail - for demonstration)

### Communication Flow Explanation

**XMPP Messages (solid arrows)**: Direct agent-to-agent communication
- Each agent sends structured messages to the next agent in the pipeline
- Messages contain conversation context and processing results
- Uses SPADE's built-in XMPP messaging system

**MCP Calls (dotted arrows)**: External service integration
- Agents call MCP servers to interact with external services
- MCP servers provide tools for GitHub, Notion, Gmail operations
- Responses are integrated back into the agent's processing

**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Interactive human consultation
- Agent asks human expert a question (e.g., "Send this email?")
- Human expert responds with decision and additional data (e.g., "Yes, send to user@example.com")
- Agent continues processing based on human response
- Bidirectional communication through web interface

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

### Understanding Agent Connections

In SPADE-LLM, agents communicate through XMPP messages. Here's how to establish connections:

#### 1. Direct Reply Configuration
The simplest way to connect agents is using the `reply_to` parameter:

```python
# Agent A sends messages to Agent B
agent_a = LLMAgent(
    jid="agent_a@server.com",
    password="password_a",
    provider=provider,
    reply_to="agent_b@server.com"  # All responses go to Agent B
)

# Agent B receives from Agent A and sends to Agent C
agent_b = LLMAgent(
    jid="agent_b@server.com", 
    password="password_b",
    provider=provider,
    reply_to="agent_c@server.com"  # Forward to Agent C
)
```

#### 2. ChatAgent Target Configuration
For user interfaces, use `target_agent_jid`:

```python
# User interface that sends to LLM Agent
chat_agent = ChatAgent(
    jid="user@server.com",
    password="password",
    target_agent_jid="assistant@server.com"  # Where user messages go
)
```

#### 3. Message Flow Pipeline
Create a processing pipeline by chaining agents:

```python
async def create_agent_pipeline():
    # Entry point: User → Chat Agent
    chat_agent = ChatAgent(
        jid="user@server.com",
        password="pwd1",
        target_agent_jid="analyzer@server.com"
    )
    
    # Step 1: Chat Agent → Analyzer Agent
    analyzer_agent = LLMAgent(
        jid="analyzer@server.com",
        password="pwd2",
        provider=provider,
        reply_to="storage@server.com"  # Forward to storage
    )
    
    # Step 2: Analyzer → Storage Agent
    storage_agent = LLMAgent(
        jid="storage@server.com",
        password="pwd3",
        provider=provider,
        reply_to="notification@server.com"  # Forward to notification
    )
    
    # Step 3: Storage → Notification Agent (end of pipeline)
    notification_agent = LLMAgent(
        jid="notification@server.com",
        password="pwd4",
        provider=provider,
        # No reply_to = end of pipeline
    )
    
    return chat_agent, analyzer_agent, storage_agent, notification_agent
```

#### 4. Conditional Routing
Use routing functions for dynamic agent selection:

```python
def smart_router(msg, response, context):
    """Route messages based on content analysis."""
    if "urgent" in response.lower():
        return "urgent_handler@server.com"
    elif "storage" in response.lower():
        return "storage_agent@server.com"
    else:
        return "default_handler@server.com"

# Agent with conditional routing
router_agent = LLMAgent(
    jid="router@server.com",
    password="password",
    provider=provider,
    routing_function=smart_router  # Dynamic routing
)
```

#### 5. Message Context Preservation
Agents automatically maintain conversation context:

```python
# Context flows through the pipeline
# User: "Analyze repository issues"
# → Chat Agent → Analyzer Agent (receives full context)
# → Storage Agent (receives context + analysis)
# → Notification Agent (receives context + analysis + storage confirmation)
```

## Step 1: Custom Guardrails

First, let's create a custom guardrail that only allows GitHub-related requests:

```python
from spade_llm.guardrails.base import Guardrail, GuardrailResult, GuardrailAction
from typing import Dict, Any

class GitHubOnlyGuardrail(Guardrail):
    """Custom guardrail that only allows GitHub-related requests."""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str = "github_only_filter", enabled: bool = True):
        super().__init__(name, enabled, "I only help with GitHub-related requests. Please ask about issues, pull requests, or repository monitoring.")
        self.github_keywords = [
            "github", "issue", "issues", "pull request", "pr", "prs", 
            "repository", "repo", "commit", "branch", "merge", "review",
            "bug", "feature", "enhancement", "milestone", "project",
            "analyze", "monitor", "check", "status", "activity"
        ]
    
    async def check(self, content: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> GuardrailResult:
        """Check if content is GitHub-related."""
        content_lower = content.lower()
        
        # Check if any GitHub keyword is present
        if any(keyword in content_lower for keyword in self.github_keywords):
            return GuardrailResult(
                action=GuardrailAction.PASS,
                content=content,
                reason="GitHub-related request detected"
            )
        else:
            return GuardrailResult(
                action=GuardrailAction.BLOCK,
                content=self.blocked_message,
                reason="Non-GitHub request blocked"
            )

def create_github_guardrails():
    """Create input guardrails for GitHub-only requests."""
    return [GitHubOnlyGuardrail()]
```

## Step 2: MCP Server Configuration

Configure external MCP servers for GitHub, Notion, and Gmail integration:

```python
from spade_llm.mcp import StreamableHttpServerConfig

def create_mcp_servers():
    """Create MCP server configurations."""
    
    # GitHub MCP server
    github_mcp = StreamableHttpServerConfig(
        name="GitHubMCP",
        url="https://your-mcp-server.com/github/endpoint",  # Replace with your MCP server
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "User-Agent": "SPADE_LLM/1.0"
        },
        timeout=30.0,
        sse_read_timeout=300.0,
        terminate_on_close=True,
        cache_tools=True
    )
    
    # Notion MCP server
    notion_mcp = StreamableHttpServerConfig(
        name="NotionMCP",
        url="https://your-mcp-server.com/notion/endpoint",  # Replace with your MCP server
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "User-Agent": "SPADE_LLM/1.0"
        },
        timeout=30.0,
        sse_read_timeout=300.0,
        terminate_on_close=True,
        cache_tools=True
    )
    
    # Gmail MCP server
    gmail_mcp = StreamableHttpServerConfig(
        name="GmailMCP",
        url="https://your-mcp-server.com/gmail/endpoint",  # Replace with your MCP server
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "User-Agent": "SPADE_LLM/1.0"
        },
        timeout=30.0,
        sse_read_timeout=300.0,
        terminate_on_close=True,
        cache_tools=True
    )
    
    return github_mcp, notion_mcp, gmail_mcp
```

## Step 3: Specialized Agent System Prompts

Create detailed system prompts for each agent:

```python
GITHUB_ANALYZER_PROMPT = """You are a GitHub analysis specialist. You receive GitHub monitoring requests and provide comprehensive repository analysis.

def create_human_tool(human_expert_jid: str):
    """Create human-in-the-loop tool for email confirmations."""
    return HumanInTheLoopTool(
        human_expert_jid=human_expert_jid,
        timeout=300.0,  # 5 minutes timeout
        name="ask_human_expert",
        description="Ask human expert for email sending confirmation and recipient details"
    )
```
